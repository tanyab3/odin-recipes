    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
        ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
            <li> Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    
        </ul>
